Acceptance Rates into UCs from Public High Schools in Each County

Using Python, our code takes the amount of students in each county who got admission into different UCs and the total amount of students in each county and converts these two values into percentages. Next, it gets rid of any counties that are missing from either data tables and it plots this data into a graph.
